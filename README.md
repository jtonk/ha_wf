# Windfinder Home Assistant Integration

This repository contains a custom integration that displays wind conditions from Windfinder. Data is fetched directly from windfinder.com.

## Installation

1. Copy this repository into your Home Assistant `config` directory so the structure looks like `custom_components/windfinder`.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Use HACS or the integrations page to add **Windfinder** and follow the setup flow to configure your location.

The integration refreshes data every 30 minutes by default. The update frequency
can be adjusted later via the integration options in Home Assistant.

## Development

The backend fetches data directly from windfinder.com based on the configured
location. Each configured location creates a device with a single sensor named
after the location (for example `sensor.hawf_noordwijk`). The sensor's state is
the timestamp of the last update reported on Windfinder. A refresh button is
also added for each device so data can be fetched on demand. All timestamps are
converted to UTC. Forecast data and current conditions are stored in the
sensor's attributes for further use.

## Sensor Attributes

The sensor exposes the following attributes:

- `forecastdata` and `superforecastdata` contain the hourly data for the regular
  forecast and superforecast respectively.
- `forecast_generated` / `forecast_fetched` provide the UTC timestamps when the
  regular forecast was generated by Windfinder and when it was fetched by the
  integration.
- `superforecast_generated` / `superforecast_fetched` provide the same
  timestamps for the superforecast.
- `spot_name` contains the name of the location as reported by Windfinder.

## Refresh Service

In addition to the refresh button entity, the integration exposes a service
`windfinder.refresh` to trigger an immediate update. Provide the `location`
exactly as configured when calling the service. This can be used in
automations or scripts. Example:

```yaml
service: windfinder.refresh
data:
  location: hawf_noordwijk
```
